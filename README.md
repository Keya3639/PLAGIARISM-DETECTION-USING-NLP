# PLAGIARISM-DETECTION-USING-NLP
The **Plagiarism Detection System** is a Python-based application that detects copied or paraphrased text using semantic similarity instead of simple keyword matching. Built with modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this tool identifies whether two pieces of text convey the same meaning even if the wording is changed.
It helps students, teachers, researchers, and developers automatically check documents for plagiarism in a smarter and more reliable way.

## Overview

This system uses **Sentence Embeddings** generated by a pre-trained model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and stores them in a **FAISS similarity index.** Instead of comparing raw words, the model converts text into numeric vectors that represent meaning.

When the user enters text, the system:
- Converts it into an embedding
- Searches for the closest matches in the database
- Calculates semantic distance (L2 distance)
- Flags plagiarism when similarity is high

This makes it effective even against:
- Rewritten sentences
- Paraphrasing
- Word substitutions
- Slight rearrangements
It runs as an interactive Streamlit web app, making it simple and user-friendly.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for logic and development.

- **Streamlit:** Builds an easy-to-use web interface.

- **Sentence-Transformers:** Generates sentence embeddings for semantic meaning.

- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** Fast vector search engine for similarity matching.

- **NumPy:** Handles numerical operations and arrays.

- **Pandas:** Loads and processes CSV data containing reference text.

## Why These Tools Were Selected

- Sentence-Transformers allow accurate semantic comparison instead of keyword matching.
- FAISS performs fast nearest-neighbor searches even on large datasets.
- Streamlit turns Python scripts into web apps with minimal code.
- Pandas + NumPy simplify data handling and computation.
- Python has strong NLP ecosystem and clean syntax.

Together, these tools make the system fast, scalable, and easy to extend.

## Features

- Checks plagiarism using semantic similarity
- Detects paraphrased or rewritten text
- Adjustable plagiarism threshold
- Displays nearest matching sentences from database
- Flags suspected copied content clearly
- Simple web-based interface
- Supports CSV-based datasets

## How It Works

- Load CSV file (www.csv) with text columns
- Generate embeddings for all sentences
- Build FAISS similarity index
- Uses pastes text into the app
- System compares input with stored database
- Returns similarity scores and plagiarism flags
## Advantages

- Detects plagiarism beyond exact copy-paste
- Works for paraphrasing and sentence rephrasing
- Fast search with FAISS indexing
- Simple interface usable by non-technical users
- Can expand with more datasets easily
- Uses pre-trained models (no training required)
## Limitations

- Requires good quality reference database
- Threshold tuning is sometimes subjective
- May give false positives for very common sentences
- Performance depends on hardware when indexing large datasets
- Not a legal plagiarism proof tool — acts as a detection assistant
## Real-Time Applications

- **Education:** Check assignments, reports, and research submissions
- **Research:** Verify originality in academic papers
- **Publishing:** Detect copied article or blog content
- **Corporate:** Prevent duplicate documentation
- **Content moderation:** Identify reused or auto-generated text
## Future Enhancements

- Support for document uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Highlight plagiarized sections inside text
- Larger language model integration
- Multi-language plagiarism detection
- Backend database storage instead of CSV
- Export plagiarism report as PDF
- Web deployment (Cloud / HuggingFace / Streamlit Cloud)

## Conclusion

The **Plagiarism Detection System** provides an intelligent approach to plagiarism checking by focusing on meaning instead of exact wording. Using sentence embeddings and FAISS similarity search, it is capable of identifying paraphrased and modified text effectively.
With further development, it can become a highly reliable plagiarism analysis tool for academic, professional, and research environments.
